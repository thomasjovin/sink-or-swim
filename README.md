# sink-or-swim
The goal of this project is to determine whether or not a passenger survives the disaster based on a number of personal features, such as age and gender.

The train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.

The sink_or_swim.ipynb file outlines my approach for classifying if a passenger will survive or not survive.
